                <p class="content-text">At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces 
                    of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?),
                     structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed 
                     content such as images and videos into a page.
                     This module will introduce the first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.

                    written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).
                     CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

                <p class="content-text">JavaScript (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions,
                    and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well. It is a 
                    prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, 
                    and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.

                <p class="content-text">React is the most popular front-end JavaScript library in the field of web development. 
                    It is used by large, established companies and newly-minted startups alike (Netflix, Airbnb, Instagram, and the New York Times,
                     to name a few).
                     React brings many advantages to the table, making it a better choice than other frameworks like Angular.js.
